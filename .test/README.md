- a test plugin!

# Compiling
- use any compiler you want as long as it's compatible with the clang compiler.

1. gather lua lib and lua headers
2. set the lua headers
3. set lua lib (dynamically link)
4. compile!
5. place the binary in serpentlua's config directory in the plugins directory
- (the config directory can be found by `gd root -> geode -> config -> yellowcat98.serpentlua`)
